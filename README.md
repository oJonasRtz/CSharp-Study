`dotnet add reference MyClassLib/MyClassLib.csproj`
- Link my project to a classlib or another project

	//in my project file (.cs)
		using MyLib

---

`Console.WriteLine($"{Sub():F2}");` 
- `F2` Indicates the number of decimal places to be seen  
- It can be used like `F1`-1 place | `F3`-3 places

`Static classes`
- Classes that can't be instantiated

`Public classes`  
- If I declare `public class Hi` its accessible in any other Projects
- If I declare `class Hi` its only accessible in the project it was created

`out`  
- It's a reference to a variable
- When calling `out` I'm required to assign a value to the variable in the function
- Use: `Function(out myVar);` or `void Function(out int number){}`
- It doesn't need to be initialized before being used as a param

`ref`
- Works similarly to `out`
- I'm not required to assign a value to the variable
- It must be initialized before being used as a param
